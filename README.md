# FLAPPYBOX

My own iteration and attempt at creating **Flappy Bird** 

I got randomly recommended a video by [Mr. Harkirat Singh](https://youtu.be/WTYiNvJt6c0?si=gE8GxNBqXS5YsNLD),  
completed his challenge, and then formatted my code while adding some new functionalities.

My plan is to port this on C using raylib and others too ,
currently my codes in in `web/` folder .
